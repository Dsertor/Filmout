        <p class="w-full text-lg text-neutral-400 overflow-hidden text-ellipsis line-clamp-3">A few years after the
            Civil War, a stagecoach travels through the wintry landscape of Wyoming. The passengers, bounty hunter John
            Ruth and his fugitive Daisy Domergue, are on their way to Red Rock, where Ruth will hand Domergue over to
            the authorities. Along the way, they encounter two strangers: Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), a
            former Union soldier turned bounty hunter with a notorious reputation, and Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), a
            Southern renegade who claims to be the new sheriff of the town. As a blizzard approaches, the four take
            refuge in Minnie's Haberdashery, a stagecoach stop at a mountain pass. Upon arriving, they come across four
            unfamiliar faces: the Mexican Bob (Demian Bichir), Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), the executioner of Red Rock,
            cowboy Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), and Confederate General Sanford Smithers (Bruce Dern). As the storm rages
            over the mountain stop, the eight travelers realize they might not make it to Red Rock after all.</p>
